Scripts created for School Days HQ and Shiny Days modding. Cross Days support isn't guarenteed until it gets an english release.

# Getting Started
Before you begin modding this game you need to extract all of the files from the GPKs. I have included a script to do so. 

Movie files are encoded in WMV  
Audio files are encoded in Vorbis OGG  
Image files are encoded in PNG

Movie and image files by default won't scale correctly to the screen if they are bigger then the original size, I've found setting [UseYUVSetting] inside of /Ini/DX9GRAPHIC.INI to "1" can improve this, but I recommend just scaling your videos and images to fit within the original files resoluton.
